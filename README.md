# EEE4120F_Pracs

For a detailed overview of the practicals, visit http://ocw.ee.uct.ac.za/courses/EEE4120F/

The pracs are being revised for 2021 (the Archive directory contains the 2020 versions) 

## Prac 1: Octave
An introduction to benchmarking, the golden measure, speed-up and report writing.

## Prac 2: OpenCL
Investigate how heterogenous computing can effect measured wall clock time, and when and where heterogenous computing is worth it or not due to transfer overheads.

## Prac 3: MPI
Learn about distributed memory programming models by applying filters to images.

## Prac 4: Simulation-based Intro to IP Core Integration Using Xilinx Vivado (under dev)
Learn about using Xilinx Vivado, it's simulator and intergrating an IP core into a project.

_Students choose to complete either Prac 5a or Prac 5b_

## Prac 5a: Advanced Module Design and Simulation Techniques using Xilinx Vivado (under dev)
More advanced use of Xilinx Vivado and simulation techniques using this tool.

## Prac 5b: FPGA intro using the Digilent Nexys platform (under dev)
More advanced use of Xilinx Vivado and simulation techniques using this tool.

_Other resources_

## PracticalManual
Contains latex source code for the pracical manual.

## YODAProject
Contains latex source code for YODA Project manual.

_See Archive for backup of old (2020) versions of pracs 4-5_

## Prac 4 (2020): FPGA Wall clock
An introduction to reconfigurable hardware. Students create a wall clock on a Nexys board (Nexys 4 DDR or Nexys A7 suggested).

## Prac 5 (2020): Vivado IP and Resource Usage
Using a full sine wave look up table and a quarter sinewave look up table, compare and contrast resources used (including time) to create a simple arpeggiator.

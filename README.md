For a detailed overview of the practicals, visit http://ocw.ee.uct.ac.za/courses/EEE4120F/

## Prac 1: Octave
An introduction to benchmarking, the golden measure, speed-up and report writing.

## Prac 2: OpenCL
Investigate how heterogenous computing can effect measured wall clock time, and when and where heterogenous computing is worth it or not due to transfer overheads.

## Prac 3: MPI
Learn about distributed memory programming models by applying filters to images.

## Prac 4: FPGA Wall clock
An introduction to reconfigurable hardware. Students create a wall clock on a Nexys board (Nexys 4 DDR or Nexys A7 suggested).

## Prac 5: Vivado IP and Resource Usage
Using a full sine wave look up table and a quarter sinewave look up table, compare and contrast resources used (including time) to create a simple arpeggiator.

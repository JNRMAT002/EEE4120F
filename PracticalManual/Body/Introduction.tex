\section*{Introduction}
Welcome to the practicals for EEE4120F. These instruction are applicable to all practicals so please take note.

Practicals take place on a Thursday, from 3PM to 6PM. You are responsible for attending these practicals and making use of the resources available. Many of these practicals will require access to specialist hardware that will only be available during the practical session.

It is assumed you have knowledge regarding tools such as git, \LaTeX{} and running programs from the Linux command line.

It is suggested you have a dual boot system. The reason for this is that development tools are generally better on a Linux based system, whereas proprietary tools are often better supported on Windows. We recommend Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, though swapping between Ubuntu (or any Linux distro) and Windows is an effective strategy, particularly when using proprietary software.

The source code for all pracs is available on the EE-OCW GitHub Project Page: \href{https://github.com/UCT-EE-OCW/EEE4120F-Pracs}{https://github.com/UCT-EE-OCW/EEE4120F-Pracs}. You can download the source code for pracs from there.
